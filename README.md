**Exploratory Data Analysis of Student Performance Dataset**

---

## 4. Dataset Information

- **Dataset Title:** Student Performance Dataset  
- **Source Website / URL:** Kaggle  
- **Description of the Dataset:**  
  The dataset contains information about students’ academic performance, study time, attendance, and demographic factors.
- **Why this Dataset was Selected:**  
  This dataset allows meaningful analysis of factors that affect student performance and is suitable for data analysis using Pandas.
- **Size of Dataset:**  
  Rows: ~1000  
  Columns: ~15  

---

## 5. Project Objectives

- To analyze factors affecting student academic performance  
- To identify patterns and trends in the data  
- To answer questions such as:
  - Does study time affect grades?
  - Is attendance related to performance?
- To gain insights using data analysis techniques

---

## 6. Data Preparation (Using Pandas)

The following steps will be performed:

- Loading the dataset using Pandas  
- Cleaning the data (handling missing values, duplicates)  
- Converting data types if needed  
- Creating new features for analysis  

---

## 7. Data Analysis Tasks

Meaningful data analysis will be performed using Pandas operations:
